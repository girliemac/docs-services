# Getting started with Nexmo on Bluemix
{: #gettingstarted}


[Nexmo](https://nexmo.com), The Vonage API Platform, provides tools for voice, messaging and phone verification, enabling you to embed programmable communications into mobile apps, websites and business systems. Nexmo APIs include SMS text messaging, two-factor authentication, voice, chat, and social media connect.

To get started with Nexmo APIs on Bluemix:

1. If you don't already have a Nexmo account, [sign up for ](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up)an account{:new_window}.

2. Login to [Nexmo Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings){:new_window}. Scroll to the **API Settings** section to get your API credentials. You will need the *API Key* and *API Secret* for this tutorial.

This step-by-step instruction uses Node.js, so you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Once you are ready, let’s get started!

## Creating a New Application

Go to your [Dashboard](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps/), and click the **Create App** button:

![Create an app](images/01-create-app.png)

Next, scroll down to *Cloud Foundry Apps*, and choose **SDK for Node.js** :

![Create an app](images/02-create-app-js.png)

Then, give your new application a unique name. In this tutorial, you are going to build a very simple app that just send an SMS message to your phone number, so let’s name it something like "send-SMS". Then click **Create**:

![Create an app](images/03-name-app.png)

Now, it takes you to the dashboard and you should see some progress indicators that shows you the new application has been created.

## Using Nexmo with the New Application

You are going to use Nexmo to simply send a SMS message. Click **Catalog** at the top menu bar:

![Create an app](images/04-go-to-catalog.png)

At the catalog, search **Nexmo** under *Application Services*, then click it:

![Create an app](images/05-add-nexmo.png)

At the next screen, fill out your Nexmo **API Key** and **API Secret**.

![Create an app](images/06-api-credentials.png)

Now. click **Create**, then press **Create Connection** at the next screen to connect it with the new application you just created.

### Downloading Your Template Files

After you connected the Nexmo service to your "send-sms" application, click the app, then **Getting Started** from the side menu, then click “*Download the Sample Code*” link to get the zip file to your computer, then unzip it. The folder should contain the template code files. Now you are ready to leave the Bluemix dashboard!



## Using the Cloud Foundry Command Line interface

To download, modify, and redeploy your Cloud Foundry applications and service instances, you need to download and install the [Cloud Foundry command line interface](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/install_cli.html) (CLI).

After the installation, use the `cf` command to login and connect to the Bluemix environment:

```bash
$ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
```

Or use the API endpoint for your region, [https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net](https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net/) (United Kingdom) and [https://api.au-syd.bluemix.net](https://api.au-syd.bluemix.net/) (Sydney).

Then login:

```bash
$ cf login
```

Now you got your Bluemix set up, so you can get started creating your Node.js application.

## Setting up Your Nexmo Phone Number

In this tutorial, we are going to create a very basic app that sends a SMS message from your Nexmo phone number to your mobile phone number.

You can get your own number by going to your [Nexmo dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/) and click **Numbers** from the top menu bar. Although can purchase any numbers with a country code of your choice, to avoid the international fee, you should choose a number with the same country code with your mobile phone number where you are sending SMS to.

![image alt text](images/nexmo-buy-numbers.png)

## Using the Nexmo REST API Client for Node.js

Now, let’s code! Make sure that node.js is installed on your machine to start coding.

Take a look at the project folder that you previously downloaded from your Bluemix dashboard. Or should contains files like this:

```bash
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── app.js
├── manifest.yml
├── package.json
└── public
    ├── images
    ├── index.html
    └── stylesheets
        ...
```

On terminal, `cd` to the project root, then use the `npm` command to install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then install Nexmo Node.js client library:

```bash
$ npm install nexmo --save
```

This will add the `nexmo` as the dependencies in your **package.json** file automatically.

Also, check your **manifest.yml** file, which is used by Bluemix for the deployment. It should look like this:

```bash
applications:
- path: .
  services
  - Nexmo-yl
  name: send-sms
  host: send-sms
...
```

For the service name,  you have an automatically generated for your application. It usually look like, `nexmo-`, and two random characters, such as `nexmo-yl`. You will need your service name at the next step.

Now, open the **app.js** file. At the end of the code template, assign your Nexmo API credentials. You can access your Nexmo credentials within the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable with `cfenv` that parses Cloud Foundry-provided environment variables:

```javascript
// The next two lines have been declared already in the template
const cfenv = require('cfenv');
const appEnv = cfenv.getAppEnv();

// Copy and paste these lines to your app.js
const nexmoApiKey = appEnv.getServiceCreds('Nexmo-j1')['api_key'];
const nexmoApiSecret = appEnv.getServiceCreds('Nexmo-j1')['api_secret'];
```

Again, the name must match *your* generated service name. To find out all the `VCAP_SERVICES` info, use `cf env [APP_NAME]` command on terminal.

Now, initialize a Nexmo instance with the credentials:

```javascript
const Nexmo = require('nexmo');

const nexmo = new Nexmo({
  apiKey: nexmoApiKey,
  apiSecret: nexmoApiSecret
});
```

### Sending SMS Messages with Node.js

Now, let's send a SMS message from your Nexmo virtual number to your real mobile phone!

To send a message, use the `nexmo.sms.sendSms` function and pass your virtual number (`YOUR_VIRTUAL_NUMBER`) you are sending the message from, a recipient number, and the message to be sent. Also, you can pass [optional params](https://docs.nexmo.com/messaging/sms-api/api-reference#request), and a callback.

For this exercise, let’s simply hard-code your mobile real phone number (which should start with a country code, e.g. "15105551234") and a message to try the API:

```javascript
nexmo.message.sendSms(
  YOUR_VIRTUAL_NUMBER, '15105551234', 'yo',
    (err, responseData) => {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      } else {
        console.dir(responseData);
      }
    }
);
```

Now, let's deploy this app to Bluemix.



## Deploying Your Application

To deploy your application, you will be using the Cloud Foundry CLI again. You can push your code with `cf push` command:

```bash
$ cf push
```

Once your application is deployed to Bluemix and run correctly, Nexmo will send the message to your phone. The time of the actual delivery depends on your mobile phone carrier, so it can be instant, or it might take extra seconds.

I hope your mobile phone receive the first SMS message via Nexmo using Bluemix! 

Surely, this sample application isn’t the most practical, however, it should provide a good idea of how to use the Nexmo SMS API to build better applications!

To create something more practical using the Nexmo APIs, such as an app to make and receive voice calls; or setting up two-factor authentications, visit the [Nexmo Tutorial Blog](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/category/developers-2/tutorial/)!
